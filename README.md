# Authenticator 
This is a program that verifies a username and password for two separate users: 
greebt01 (password = swordfish) and 
bburd (password = preakston).
All letters in strings must be lowercase to match.  If successful, you will be told "You're in."  If unsuccessful, you will
be told "You're sispicious."
